	<p>I am a senior attending Andover Central Highschool. I have been a part of the CAPS 		program for about one semester. I enjoy activities like playing piano and guitar, 		working out, spending time with my friends adn family, and doing anything that can 		make myself and the people around me grow. I am interested in the field of computer 	science and software engineering. While I am undecided on exactly what I will do 		after highschool, I plan to continue my education either through college or a 			certification course</p>
